# GAMM analysis

## Purpose
- Purpose of this study is to test to what extent SLZ shows laryngeal complexity. 
- SLZ is a laryngeally complex language that contains:
  - five contrastive tonal patterns
  - four contrastive types of voice quality
- SLZ is an ideal language to test the claims of phasing and ordering made by Silverman 1997a,b and Blankenship 1997, 2002. 
- There have been some more recent studies that have supported this claim about laryngeal complexity in Mazatec (Garellek & Keating 2011) and Itunyoso Trique (DiCanio 2012).
- These previous studies made use of traditional linear mixed effects regression models to show that there is an interaction between tone and laryngealization. 
  - However, this requires the linguist to look at vowel piecemeal/linearly instead of looking at it dynamically. 
- Using GAMMs (Hastie & Tibshirani 1986) allow us to look at these interactions dynamically through the whole length of the vowel instead of linear interactions. 
  - This is much better for investigating measurements with temporal or spatial structure such as formant, pitch or tongue contours.
- In the case of SLZ, this will be helpful for looking at pitch and voice quality interactions.
